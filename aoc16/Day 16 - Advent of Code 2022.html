Oh, hello!  Funny seeing you here.

I appreciate your enthusiasm, but you aren't going to find much down here.
There certainly aren't clues to any of the puzzles.  The best surprises don't
even appear in the source until you unlock them for real.

Please be careful with automated requests; I'm not a massive company, and I can
only take so much traffic.  Please be considerate so that everyone gets to play.

If you're curious about how Advent of Code works, it's running on some custom
Perl code. Other than a few integrations (auth, analytics, social media), I
built the whole thing myself, including the design, animations, prose, and all
of the puzzles.

The puzzles are most of the work; preparing a new calendar and a new set of
puzzles each year takes all of my free time for 4-5 months. A lot of effort
went into building this thing - I hope you're enjoying playing it as much as I
enjoyed making it for you!

If you'd like to hang out, I'm @ericwastl on Twitter.

- Eric Wastl

<article class="day-desc"><h2>--- Day 16: Proboscidea Volcanium ---</h2><p>The
 sensors have led you to the origin of the distress signal: yet another 
handheld device, just like the one the Elves gave you. However, you 
don't see any Elves around; instead, the device is surrounded by 
elephants! They must have gotten lost in these tunnels, and one of the 
elephants apparently figured out how to turn on the distress signal.</p>
<p>The ground rumbles again, much stronger this time. What kind of cave 
is this, exactly? You scan the cave with your handheld device; it 
reports mostly igneous rock, some ash, pockets of pressurized gas, 
magma... this isn't just a cave, it's a volcano!</p>
<p>You need to get the elephants out of here, quickly. Your device estimates that you have <em>30 minutes</em> before the volcano erupts, so you don't have time to go back out the way you came in.</p>
<p>You scan the cave for other options and discover a network of pipes and pressure-release <em>valves</em>.
 You aren't sure how such a system got into a volcano, but you don't 
have time to complain; your device produces a report (your puzzle input)
 of each valve's <em>flow rate</em> if it were opened (in pressure per minute) and the tunnels you could use to move between the valves.</p>
<p>There's even a valve in the room you and the elephants are currently standing in labeled <code>AA</code>.
 You estimate it will take you one minute to open a single valve and one
 minute to follow any tunnel from one valve to another. What is the most
 pressure you could release?</p>
<p>For example, suppose you had the following scan output:</p>
<pre><code>Valve AA has flow rate=0; tunnels lead to valves DD, II, BB
Valve BB has flow rate=13; tunnels lead to valves CC, AA
Valve CC has flow rate=2; tunnels lead to valves DD, BB
Valve DD has flow rate=20; tunnels lead to valves CC, AA, EE
Valve EE has flow rate=3; tunnels lead to valves FF, DD
Valve FF has flow rate=0; tunnels lead to valves EE, GG
Valve GG has flow rate=0; tunnels lead to valves FF, HH
Valve HH has flow rate=22; tunnel leads to valve GG
Valve II has flow rate=0; tunnels lead to valves AA, JJ
Valve JJ has flow rate=21; tunnel leads to valve II
</code></pre>
<p>All of the valves begin <em>closed</em>. You start at valve <code>AA</code>, but it must be damaged or <span title="Wait, sir! The valve, sir! it appears to be... jammed!">jammed</span> or something: its flow rate is <code>0</code>, so there's no point in opening it. However, you could spend one minute moving to valve <code>BB</code> and another minute opening it; doing so would release pressure during the remaining <em>28 minutes</em> at a flow rate of <code>13</code>, a total eventual pressure release of <code>28 * 13 = <em>364</em></code>. Then, you could spend your third minute moving to valve <code>CC</code> and your fourth minute opening it, providing an additional <em>26 minutes</em> of eventual pressure release at a flow rate of <code>2</code>, or <code><em>52</em></code> total pressure released by valve <code>CC</code>.</p>
<p>Making your way through the tunnels like this, you could probably 
open many or all of the valves by the time 30 minutes have elapsed. 
However, you need to release as much pressure as possible, so you'll 
need to be methodical. Instead, consider this approach:</p>

You move to valve CC.

== Minute 24 ==

You open valve CC.

== Minute 25 ==
Valves BB, CC, DD, EE, HH, and JJ are open, releasing <em>81</em> pressure.

Valves BB, CC, DD, EE, HH, and JJ are open, releasing <em>81</em> pressure.

== Minute 27 ==
Valves BB, CC, DD, EE, HH, and JJ are open, releasing <em>81</em> pressure.

== Minute 28 ==
Valves BB, CC, DD, EE, HH, and JJ are open, releasing <em>81</em> pressure.

== Minute 29 ==
Valves BB, CC, DD, EE, HH, and JJ are open, releasing <em>81</em> pressure.

== Minute 30 ==
Valves BB, CC, DD, EE, HH, and JJ are open, releasing <em>81</em> pressure.
</code></pre>
<p>This approach lets you release the most pressure possible in 30 minutes with this valve layout, <code><em>1651</em></code>.</p>
<p>Work out the steps to release the most pressure in 30 minutes. <em>What is the most pressure you can release?</em></p>
