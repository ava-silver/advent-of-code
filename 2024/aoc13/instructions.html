Oh, hello!  Funny seeing you here.

I appreciate your enthusiasm, but you aren't going to find much down here.
There certainly aren't clues to any of the puzzles.  The best surprises don't
even appear in the source until you unlock them for real.

Please be careful with automated requests; I'm not a massive company, and I can
only take so much traffic.  Please be considerate so that everyone gets to play.

If you're curious about how Advent of Code works, it's running on some custom
Perl code. Other than a few integrations (auth, analytics, social media), I
built the whole thing myself, including the design, animations, prose, and all
of the puzzles.

The puzzles are most of the work; preparing a new calendar and a new set of
puzzles each year takes all of my free time for 4-5 months. A lot of effort
went into building this thing - I hope you're enjoying playing it as much as I
enjoyed making it for you!

If you'd like to hang out, I'm @was.tl on Bluesky, @ericwastl@hachyderm.io on
Mastodon, and @ericwastl on Twitter.

- Eric Wastl

<article class="day-desc"><h2>--- Day 13: Claw Contraption ---</h2><p>Next up: the <a href="/2020/day/24">lobby</a> of a resort on a tropical island. The Historians take a moment to admire the hexagonal floor tiles before spreading out.</p>
<p>Fortunately, it looks like the resort has a new <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amusement_arcade">arcade</a>! Maybe you can win some prizes from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claw_machine" target="_blank">claw machines</a>?</p>
<p>The claw machines here are a little unusual. Instead of a joystick or directional buttons to control the claw, these machines have two buttons labeled <code>A</code> and <code>B</code>. Worse, you can't just put in a token and play; it costs <em>3 tokens</em> to push the <code>A</code> button and <em>1 token</em> to push the <code>B</code> button.</p>
<p>With a little experimentation, you figure out that each machine's buttons are configured to move the claw a specific amount to the <em>right</em> (along the <code>X</code> axis) and a specific amount <em>forward</em> (along the <code>Y</code> axis) each time that button is pressed.</p>
<p>Each machine contains one <em>prize</em>; to win the prize, the claw must be positioned <em>exactly</em> above the prize on both the <code>X</code> and <code>Y</code> axes.</p>
<p>You wonder: what is the smallest number of tokens you would have to spend to win as many prizes as possible? You assemble a list of every machine's button behavior and prize location (your puzzle input). For example:</p>
<pre><code>Button A: X+94, Y+34
Button B: X+22, Y+67
Prize: X=8400, Y=5400

Button A: X+26, Y+66
Button B: X+67, Y+21
Prize: X=12748, Y=12176

Button A: X+17, Y+86
Button B: X+84, Y+37
Prize: X=7870, Y=6450

Button A: X+69, Y+23
Button B: X+27, Y+71
Prize: X=18641, Y=10279
</code></pre>
<p>This list describes the button configuration and prize location of four different claw machines.</p>
<p>For now, consider just the first claw machine in the list:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pushing the machine's <code>A</code> button would move the claw <code>94</code> units along the <code>X</code> axis and <code>34</code> units along the <code>Y</code> axis.</li>
<li>Pushing the <code>B</code> button would move the claw <code>22</code> units along the <code>X</code> axis and <code>67</code> units along the <code>Y</code> axis.</li>
<li>The prize is located at <code>X=8400</code>, <code>Y=5400</code>; this means that from the claw's initial position, it would need to move exactly <code>8400</code> units along the <code>X</code> axis and exactly <code>5400</code> units along the <code>Y</code> axis to be perfectly aligned with the prize in this machine.</li>
</ul>
<p>The cheapest way to win the prize is by pushing the <code>A</code> button <code>80</code> times and the <code>B</code> button <code>40</code> times. This would line up the claw along the <code>X</code> axis (because <code>80*94 + 40*22 = 8400</code>) and along the <code>Y</code> axis (because <code>80*34 + 40*67 = 5400</code>). Doing this would cost <code>80*3</code> tokens for the <span title="Half A presses are not allowed."><code>A</code> presses</span> and <code>40*1</code> for the <code>B</code> presses, a total of <code><em>280</em></code> tokens.</p>
<p>For the second and fourth claw machines, there is no combination of A and B presses that will ever win a prize.</p>
<p>For the third claw machine, the cheapest way to win the prize is by pushing the <code>A</code> button <code>38</code> times and the <code>B</code> button <code>86</code> times. Doing this would cost a total of <code><em>200</em></code> tokens.</p>
<p>So, the most prizes you could possibly win is two; the minimum tokens you would have to spend to win all (two) prizes is <code><em>480</em></code>.</p>
<p>You estimate that each button would need to be pressed <em>no more than <code>100</code> times</em> to win a prize. How else would someone be expected to play?</p>
<p>Figure out how to win as many prizes as possible. <em>What is the fewest tokens you would have to spend to win all possible prizes?</em></p>
