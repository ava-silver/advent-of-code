Oh, hello!  Funny seeing you here.

I appreciate your enthusiasm, but you aren't going to find much down here.
There certainly aren't clues to any of the puzzles.  The best surprises don't
even appear in the source until you unlock them for real.

Please be careful with automated requests; I'm not a massive company, and I can
only take so much traffic.  Please be considerate so that everyone gets to play.

If you're curious about how Advent of Code works, it's running on some custom
Perl code. Other than a few integrations (auth, analytics, social media), I
built the whole thing myself, including the design, animations, prose, and all
of the puzzles.

The puzzles are most of the work; preparing a new calendar and a new set of
puzzles each year takes all of my free time for 4-5 months. A lot of effort
went into building this thing - I hope you're enjoying playing it as much as I
enjoyed making it for you!

If you'd like to hang out, I'm @was.tl on Bluesky, @ericwastl@hachyderm.io on
Mastodon, and @ericwastl on Twitter.

- Eric Wastl

<article class="day-desc"><h2>--- Day 12: Garden Groups ---</h2><p>Why not search for the Chief Historian near the <a href="/2023/day/5">gardener</a> and his <a href="/2023/day/21">massive farm</a>? There's plenty of food, so The Historians grab something to eat while they search.</p>
<p>You're about to settle near a complex arrangement of garden plots when some Elves ask if you can lend a hand. They'd like to set up <span title="I originally wanted to title this puzzle &quot;Fencepost Problem&quot;, but I was afraid someone would then try to count fenceposts by mistake and experience a fencepost problem.">fences</span> around each region of garden plots, but they can't figure out how much fence they need to order or how much it will cost. They hand you a map (your puzzle input) of the garden plots.</p>
<p>Each garden plot grows only a single type of plant and is indicated by a single letter on your map. When multiple garden plots are growing the same type of plant and are touching (horizontally or vertically), they form a <em>region</em>. For example:</p>
<pre><code>AAAA
BBCD
BBCC
EEEC
</code></pre>
<p>This 4x4 arrangement includes garden plots growing five different types of plants (labeled <code>A</code>, <code>B</code>, <code>C</code>, <code>D</code>, and <code>E</code>), each grouped into their own region.</p>
<p>In order to accurately calculate the cost of the fence around a single region, you need to know that region's <em>area</em> and <em>perimeter</em>.</p>
<p>The <em>area</em> of a region is simply the number of garden plots the region contains. The above map's type <code>A</code>, <code>B</code>, and <code>C</code> plants are each in a region of area <code>4</code>. The type <code>E</code> plants are in a region of area <code>3</code>; the type <code>D</code> plants are in a region of area <code>1</code>.</p>
<p>Each garden plot is a square and so has <em>four sides</em>. The <em>perimeter</em> of a region is the number of sides of garden plots in the region that do not touch another garden plot in the same region. The type <code>A</code> and <code>C</code> plants are each in a region with perimeter <code>10</code>. The type <code>B</code> and <code>E</code> plants are each in a region with perimeter <code>8</code>. The lone <code>D</code> plot forms its own region with perimeter <code>4</code>.</p>
<p>Visually indicating the sides of plots in each region that contribute to the perimeter using <code>-</code> and <code>|</code>, the above map's regions' perimeters are measured as follows:</p>
<pre><code>+-+-+-+-+
|A A A A|
+-+-+-+-+     +-+
              |D|
+-+-+   +-+   +-+
|B B|   |C|
+   +   + +-+
|B B|   |C C|
+-+-+   +-+ +
          |C|
+-+-+-+   +-+
|E E E|
+-+-+-+
</code></pre>
<p>Plants of the same type can appear in multiple separate regions, and regions can even appear within other regions. For example:</p>
<pre><code>OOOOO
OXOXO
OOOOO
OXOXO
OOOOO
</code></pre>
<p>The above map contains <em>five</em> regions, one containing all of the <code>O</code> garden plots, and the other four each containing a single <code>X</code> plot.</p>
<p>The four <code>X</code> regions each have area <code>1</code> and perimeter <code>4</code>. The region containing <code>21</code> type <code>O</code> plants is more complicated; in addition to its outer edge contributing a perimeter of <code>20</code>, its boundary with each <code>X</code> region contributes an additional <code>4</code> to its perimeter, for a total perimeter of <code>36</code>.</p>
<p>Due to "modern" business practices, the <em>price</em> of fence required for a region is found by <em>multiplying</em> that region's area by its perimeter. The <em>total price</em> of fencing all regions on a map is found by adding together the price of fence for every region on the map.</p>
<p>In the first example, region <code>A</code> has price <code>4 * 10 = 40</code>, region <code>B</code> has price <code>4 * 8 = 32</code>, region <code>C</code> has price <code>4 * 10 = 40</code>, region <code>D</code> has price <code>1 * 4 = 4</code>, and region <code>E</code> has price <code>3 * 8 = 24</code>. So, the total price for the first example is <code><em>140</em></code>.</p>
<p>In the second example, the region with all of the <code>O</code> plants has price <code>21 * 36 = 756</code>, and each of the four smaller <code>X</code> regions has price <code>1 * 4 = 4</code>, for a total price of <code><em>772</em></code> (<code>756 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4</code>).</p>
<p>Here's a larger example:</p>
<pre><code>RRRRIICCFF
RRRRIICCCF
VVRRRCCFFF
VVRCCCJFFF
VVVVCJJCFE
VVIVCCJJEE
VVIIICJJEE
MIIIIIJJEE
MIIISIJEEE
MMMISSJEEE
</code></pre>
<p>It contains:</p>
<ul>
<li>A region of <code>R</code> plants with price <code>12 * 18 = 216</code>.</li>
<li>A region of <code>I</code> plants with price <code>4 * 8 = 32</code>.</li>
<li>A region of <code>C</code> plants with price <code>14 * 28 = 392</code>.</li>
<li>A region of <code>F</code> plants with price <code>10 * 18 = 180</code>.</li>
<li>A region of <code>V</code> plants with price <code>13 * 20 = 260</code>.</li>
<li>A region of <code>J</code> plants with price <code>11 * 20 = 220</code>.</li>
<li>A region of <code>C</code> plants with price <code>1 * 4 = 4</code>.</li>
<li>A region of <code>E</code> plants with price <code>13 * 18 = 234</code>.</li>
<li>A region of <code>I</code> plants with price <code>14 * 22 = 308</code>.</li>
<li>A region of <code>M</code> plants with price <code>5 * 12 = 60</code>.</li>
<li>A region of <code>S</code> plants with price <code>3 * 8 = 24</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, it has a total price of <code><em>1930</em></code>.</p>
<p><em>What is the total price of fencing all regions on your map?</em></p>
